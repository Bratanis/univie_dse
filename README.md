# About this project

These are my solutions to certain tasks from the "distributed systems engineering" subject of the University of Vienna. 

The first task was to create a hamming number generator that leverages concurrency while maintaining thread saftey.

For the second task a client and a server are exchanging data, using both TCP and UDP. This program also uses multi threading

The last implemented task is an openApi description for a meeting scheduler app. After manually writing the description (using swagger tools), a stub was automatically generated and I wrote integration tests for the endpoints.
